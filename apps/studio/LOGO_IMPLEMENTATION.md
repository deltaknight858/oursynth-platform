# Logo Implementation Guide

## Current Status
✅ Logo component created at `src/components/Logo.tsx`
✅ Integrated in Layout header with frosted glass styling
✅ Added to studio page footer-header
✅ SVG placeholder logo created at `public/assets/logo.svg`

## Features Implemented
- **Frosted Glass Effect**: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` with rgba transparency
- **Neon Hover Effects**: Purple-green-blue gradient glow on hover
- **Responsive Design**: max-height: 40px with auto width
- **Fallback System**: Inline SVG fallback if external file fails
- **Gradient Border**: 2px gradient border under logo area in header
- **Sticky Header**: Position sticky maintained with gradient effects

## Logo Component Features
- React functional component with TypeScript
- styled-components with hover animations
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Accessibility with proper alt text
- Drop shadow effects with neon colors

## File Structure
```
src/
  components/
    Logo.tsx          // Main logo component
  app/
    layout.tsx        // Global layout (not modified)
public/
  assets/
    logo.svg          // Current logo file
    logo.png          // Reserved for future PNG logo
```

## To Replace with Custom Logo
1. Add your logo file to `public/assets/logo.png`
2. Update `src/components/Logo.tsx`:
   - Change `src="/assets/logo.svg"` to `src="/assets/logo.png"`
   - Adjust max-height if needed (currently 40px)
3. The frosted glass styling and hover effects will remain

## Styling Details
- Glass morphism: `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` with blur(12px)
- Neon glow: `0 0 8px rgba(0,255,204,0.6), 0 0 12px rgba(160,32,240,0.4)`
- Gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #00FFCC 0%, #A020F0 50%, #0066FF 100%)`
- Border radius: 8px for consistent design language
- Padding: 4px 8px for comfortable spacing

## Integration Points
1. **Header**: Top navigation with sticky positioning
2. **Studio Footer**: Centered logo at bottom of studio page
3. **All Routes**: Logo appears consistently across application

Both locations use the same Logo component for consistency.
